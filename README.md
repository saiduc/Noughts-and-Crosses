# Noughts and Crosses
This is a command line implementation of the Noughts and Crosses game (also called Tic-Tac-Toe). This was part of a programming module at Imperial College London. I wrote this after my 2048 project, so some of the code is reused.

## Usage
Compile it however you compile C++ programs on your OS. For macOS and Linux with the G++ compiler, run within the directory the source file is in:
```
g++ noughtsandcrosses.cpp -o noughtsandcrosses
```

## Features
* Takes user input with wasd in the terminal
* Prints the board in terminal
* Coin toss function that determines who will go first
* Basic computer AI that will actively try to win and block player's near wins
* Detects when the player has won/lost/drawn

## Requirements
* A C++11 compiler to compile the source code

## Some Notes on What I Learned
This was written after my 2048 game so I reused some of the code, especially in the board construction and printing. I felt a lot more confident with C++ when I made this so I put it together fairly quickly. I didn't really have to learn anything new for this but I got the opportunity to practice and improve the C++ skills I had developed during my 2048 project.
